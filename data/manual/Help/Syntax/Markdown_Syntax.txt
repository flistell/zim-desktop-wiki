====== Markdown Syntax ======

Examples of the markdown syntax as used by Zim.

Most of this syntax is inspired by the [[http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax|markdown]] syntax, but with some significant modifications.

===== Headings =====

Headings are created by using an appropriate amount of "#" characters:

'''
# Head 1

## head 2

### head 3

#### head 4

##### head 5
'''

Zim also support headubg wuth trailing # like: ''## head 2 #####'' and title:

'''
head 1
===

head 2
-----------
'''


===== Links =====

Link to another page like this:

'''
<foo>  links to a page on the same level or up
<:foo> links to a page in the top level of the notebook
<+foo> links to a sub-page

[bar](foo) links to "foo" but display "bar"
'''

External links like http://nongnu.org are also supported

===== Lists =====

Bullet list just use a "*" at the start of the line:

'''
* item 1
* item 2
* item 3
	* item 3a
'''

Will be rendered as:

* item 1
* item 2
* item 3
	* item 3a
	
Numbered lists use a "1.", "a.", or "A." as bullets:

1. item 1
2. item 2
3. item 3
	a. item 3a

Numbered lists can start with an arbitrary number. However internal inconsistencies will be fixed by renumbering automatically. Off course you can mix numbered lists with bullet sub-lists and vice versa.

Checkbox lists look like this:

'''
[ ] foo
[*] bar
	[*] sub item 1
	[*] sub item 2
[x] baz
'''

This renders as:

[ ] foo
[*] bar
	[*] sub item 1
	[*] sub item 2
[x] baz

Of course the checkboxes are clickable in zim. See [[Check Boxes]] for more details.

===== Markup =====
**bold**, //italic// and __underline__ and ''verbatim''

'''
**bold** or __bold__, *italic* or _italic_ and //underline// and ``verbatim``
'''

and also ~~strike through~~	

'''
and also ~~strike through~~
'''

Using verbatim also prevents any further parsing of the content. To render a whole block as verbatim the first and last line of the block should contain 3 backquotes and no other characters:

'''
Sing, O goddess, the rage of
Achilles son of Peleus, that
brought countless ills upon
the Achaeans.
'''

This can be used for code examples etc.

Indent paragraph with four or more space or a tabulation also render it as verbatim.

===== Images =====

To include images use: 
'''

![foobar alternative description](./foobar.png)
'''

The filename for an image can either be absolute or relative. If relative it is looked for in the same directory as where the text source of the current page is.
